            <p className="py-2 text-base md:text-lg text-grey-400">
              I&apos;m a self-learner and progressive developer who specializes
              mostly in frontend technologies such as ReactJS, VueJS, and
              frameworks like NextJS and NuxtJS. I am passionate about creating
              beautiful and intuitive user interfaces with a focus on
              responsiveness, interactivity, pixel-perfect design, and high
              performance.
            </p>
            <p className="py-2 text-base md:text-lg text-grey-400">
              I began my journey as a developer in 2021 (after Covid). Since
              then, frontend development has always excited me to explore new
              technologies and learn new things. I&apos;ve continued to grow and
              evolve as a developer. Along the way, I first encountered ReactJS
              and NextJS, using which I have built projects. Then, after some
              time helping a friend on his project, I learned VueJS and NuxtJS
              (which was easy to start up, as you know, once you know one
              framework/library, you can easily catch up with another) and built
              projects using them.

            <p className="py-2 text-base md:text-lg text-grey-400">
              Last year, with a friend, we wanted to build mobile applications,
              so I learned Flutter and completed interesting projects using
              Flutter, which posed new challenges.

              Along the way, I have learned and completed projects in frontend
              using NuxtJS & NextJS and mobile development using FLutter.
